# File-Validataion-With-vanilla-JavaScript

<h2>I have created this small project to help others understand how to use different methods and DOM manipulation by just using simple JavaScript.</h2>

<h3>Though this is a small project, but it covers some very deep concepts. I decided to build this project as there was no proper Answer in WEB for this question.</h3>

#Disclaimer: You can skip the "Multiple File Validation" as people don't use it that much and it is also a bit more complex. But will help in clearing some various basic concepts and how to use arrays in an advanced way.

<h4>Hope you Enjoy the Project!! ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„</h4>
